# picoMIPS-Implementation-for-an-Affine-Transformation-Algorithm

This Project presents the design and simulation of a processor architecture used for implementing an affine transformation algorithm on 2 input and gives output values afterwards. It is inspired by the PicoRisc Embedded architecture design. Then each module was created and tested through simulation to verify its operation. Then integration of the modules was made under an encapsulating module (CPU). Modifications such as changing instruction format and creating unique instructions were made to reduce the size of the design as much as possible while keeping it efficient and fast. Finally, design was uploaded on FPGA to synthesize it which showed correct behaviour in real life similar to the simulation that was made on Modelsim
